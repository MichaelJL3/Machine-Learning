# Machine Learning
only one project

# Note
The project is missing some of the database files because they contain sensitive information.
The project was to analyze if a machine could guess who a user would like and dislike. he dataset was incredibly small so we limited a user to 150 likes then split the set into 2/3 training ne third testing and received an average of ~70% correct guesses. The code works by binary classification of extracted faces from images, then running a few different machine learning algorithms.
